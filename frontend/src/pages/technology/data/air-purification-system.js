    {
      q: "What air purification system does Hawthorne Village Dental Care use?",
      a: "We use the Surgically Clean Air System, which Dr. Sarna installed after searching for the best air purification system he could find. It removes the micro-bacterial germs found in most dental offices and keeps the environment clean and fresh.",
    },
    {
      q: "How does the air purification system work?",
      a: "The system draws in room air, removes micro-bacterial germs as the air passes through, and disperses clean air back into the office. It runs continuously, so the air in every operatory is being cleaned throughout your entire visit.",
    },
    {
      q: "Is the air filtered in every treatment room?",
      a: "Yes. Every operatory at our Milton clinic is filtered continuously for your safety, it's not limited to a single room or switched on only for certain procedures.",
    },
    {
      q: "Why does air quality matter at a dental office?",
      a: "Micro-bacterial germs are found in most dental offices. Removing them from the air adds a layer of protection for patients and team members alike, and it keeps the whole clinic feeling clean and fresh rather than stale.",
    },
    {
      q: "Will I notice the air purification system during my visit?",
      a: "Probably not, and that's by design. The system works quietly in the background while you're in the chair. Most patients simply notice that the office feels clean and fresh.",
    },
    {
      q: "Does the air purification system protect children and anxious patients too?",
      a: "Yes. Because it runs continuously in every operatory, everyone who visits benefits, from one-year-olds at their first checkup to patients using our comfort-first sedation options. If you have questions, our team members are happy to walk you through it.",
