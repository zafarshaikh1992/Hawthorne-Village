  faqEyebrow: "The Wand questions",

    {
      q: "What exactly is The Wand?",
      a: "The Wand is the Single Tooth Anesthesia System® (STA®), a computer-controlled anaesthesia system used at Hawthorne Village Dental Care. It gives Dr. Sarna precise control over the location and amount of anesthetic administered, which dramatically reduces the pain of injections in the sensitive areas of the mouth.",
    },
    {
      q: "Why do dental injections normally sting?",
      a: "Most people think needles sting because the skin is pierced, but this is usually not so. Doctors have long known that the main cause of discomfort is the flow of the anesthetic into your tissues, most often, the sting was caused because the anesthetic was fired in too quickly.",
    },
    {
      q: "How does The Wand make injections more comfortable?",
      a: "A computer controls the flow of anesthetic, so the injection is guaranteed to be slow and steady, and therefore comfortable. Using the \"magic pen,\" Dr. Sarna controls both where the freezing goes and how much is delivered.",
    },
    {
      q: "I've had bad experiences with needles before. Will this help?",
      a: "Yes, that's exactly who The Wand helps most. Patients with previous bad experiences find the computer-controlled delivery very reassuring, and for anyone who's still anxious, oral conscious sedation is also available at our Milton clinic.",
    },
    {
      q: "Does The Wand look like a normal needle?",
      a: "No. It's a lightweight handpiece that looks like a pen, which is why patients call it the \"magic pen.\" For many nervous patients, not seeing a traditional syringe makes the visit easier before the freezing even starts.",
    },
    {
      q: "Is The Wand suitable for children?",
      a: "Yes. A gentle, pen-like instrument and a slow, comfortable injection fit naturally into our children's dentistry routine, where visits are kept warm, unhurried and pressure-free from age one.",
    },
    {
      q: "How do I ask about The Wand before my appointment?",
      a: "Call us at (905) 864-3368 or speak to any Hawthorne Village Dental Care team member. We're happy to answer your questions and note your comfort preferences before your visit.",
