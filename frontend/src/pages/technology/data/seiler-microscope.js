      q: "What is the Seiler Dental Microscope?",
      a: "It's a surgical microscope used at the chair, letting Dr. Sarna see teeth in microscopic detail. That means diagnosing problems he could not see before, a more accurate diagnosis and enhanced precision in treatment.",
    },
    {
      q: "How much more can it see than the naked eye?",

      q: "Why does that matter for a cracked tooth?",
      a: "A hairline fracture often can't be seen with the naked eye or even 4× loupes, only felt by the patient. Undiagnosed, the tooth can fracture completely a short time later and need removal. Under the microscope, it's caught and protected early.",

    {
      q: "When is the microscope used?",
      a: "For early detection of decay and tooth fractures, root canal therapy, and precision restorations, anywhere microscopic detail changes the outcome.",

    {
      q: "Does microscope-guided treatment cost more?",
      a: "No, it's simply how Dr. Sarna works. You'll always receive a written estimate before treatment, and we bill your insurance directly.",
