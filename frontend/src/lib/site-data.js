export const faqs = [
  { q: "Are you accepting new patients in Milton?", a: "Yes — we welcome new patients of every age, from one-year-olds visiting for their first check-up to grandparents. Most new-patient appointments are available within a week." },
  { q: "Do you accept the Canadian Dental Care Plan (CDCP)?", a: "Yes. Hawthorne Village Dental Care is a participating CDCP provider. Bring your CDCP welcome letter and Government of Canada Dental Benefits card to your appointment." },
  { q: "Do you offer direct insurance billing?", a: "We bill almost every major Canadian insurer directly, including Manulife, Sun Life, Canada Life, GreenShield, Desjardins and Blue Cross. You only pay any portion your plan does not cover." },
  { q: "What if I have a dental emergency after hours?", a: "Call (905) 864-3368 and follow the after-hours prompt. We reserve same-day slots every weekday for pain, swelling and broken teeth." },
  { q: "Where are you located in Milton?", a: "10220 Derry Road, Suite 206, Milton, ON L9T 7J3 — inside the Hawthorne Village medical complex, with free surface parking and elevator access." },
  { q: "Do you see children? What age should the first visit be?", a: "Yes. The Canadian Dental Association recommends the first visit by age one, or within six months of the first tooth. Our team makes early visits fun, short and pressure-free." },
  { q: "How much does a dental implant cost in Milton?", a: "A single implant with crown at Hawthorne Village Dental Care typically ranges from $3,500 to $5,500 depending on bone quality and materials. We provide a written estimate before any treatment begins." },
  { q: "Is Invisalign more expensive than braces?", a: "For most adult cases the price is very similar. We offer 0% financing over 12–24 months so you can spread the cost." },
  { q: "Do you use nitrous oxide (laughing gas) or oral sedation?", a: "Yes. We offer oral conscious sedation and computer-guided freezing (The Wand) for anxious patients. Deeper sedation options are discussed during your consultation." },
  { q: "Are digital X-rays safe?", a: "Digital X-rays use up to 90% less radiation than traditional film and are considered safe for children and pregnant patients when clinically indicated." },
  { q: "How long does a routine cleaning take?", a: "A standard hygiene visit runs 45–60 minutes. Your first visit takes about 90 minutes because we complete a comprehensive exam and digital records." },
  { q: "Can you help with a chipped or knocked-out tooth today?", a: "Call us immediately at (905) 864-3368. For a knocked-out permanent tooth, keep it moist (milk or saliva) and come in within 30 minutes for the best chance of saving it." },
  { q: "Do you offer teeth whitening that actually works?", a: "Yes — in-office Zoom whitening lightens teeth up to 8 shades in one visit, and take-home custom trays maintain results for years." },
  { q: "How long do dental implants last?", a: "With good oral hygiene and regular checkups, dental implants have a 95%+ ten-year success rate and often last a lifetime." },
  { q: "What is the CEREC same-day crown process?", a: "We scan your tooth digitally, design the crown on-screen, mill it from a solid ceramic block, and bond it — all in about 90 minutes. No temporaries, no second visit." },
  { q: "Do you treat sleep apnea?", a: "Yes. We provide custom oral appliances that reposition the jaw during sleep — a comfortable alternative to CPAP for mild to moderate cases." },
  { q: "Do wisdom teeth always need to come out?", a: "No. If they erupt straight, have room and can be cleaned, they can stay. We evaluate every case individually with a 3D CBCT scan." },
  { q: "Is a root canal painful?", a: "Modern root canals feel very similar to a routine filling thanks to microscope guidance and effective anaesthesia. Most patients say the pain of the infection was far worse than the treatment." },
  { q: "How often should I see the dentist?", a: "Most healthy adults benefit from a cleaning and exam every 6 months. Patients with gum disease, orthodontics, implants or a higher cavity risk may need visits every 3–4 months." },
  { q: "Do you offer payment plans?", a: "Yes. We partner with Dentalcard, PayBright and iFinance to offer 0% interest plans over 6–24 months for treatments above $500." },
  { q: "Can I bring my baby or toddler with me to my appointment?", a: "Absolutely. Our waiting area has a small kids' corner, and our team is happy to hold your little one for a quick moment if needed." },
  { q: "Which neighbourhoods do you serve near Milton?", a: "We regularly welcome patients from Hawthorne Village, Beaty, Clarke, Ford, Coates, Willmott, Scott, Bronte Meadows, Campbellville and nearby Mississauga, Oakville and Burlington." },
  { q: "Is your clinic wheelchair accessible?", a: "Yes. Elevator access, wide doorways, an accessible washroom and level operatory floors throughout." },
  { q: "Do you provide mouthguards for sports?", a: "Yes — custom-fitted mouthguards are stronger, more comfortable and better protection than boil-and-bite options." },
  { q: "What languages does your team speak?", a: "Our team speaks English, French, Hindi, Punjabi, Urdu, Tagalog and Spanish — please let us know your preference when booking." },
  { q: "How do I book an appointment?", a: "Click 'Book Appointment' on this site, call (905) 864-3368, or email hawthornedental1@gmail.com. We respond within one business hour." },
